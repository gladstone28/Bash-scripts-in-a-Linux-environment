##### Bash Scripting: What & Why?

**Learn how to write Bash scripts in a Linux environment!**

So far, weâ€™ve covered how Bash works on the command line. Bash scripts are a level up from individual commands, as powerful as they are. In Linux or any environment with a Bash shell, Bash scripts are files we can write to programmatically call Bash commands.

For example, in a Bash script, we could write a loop that calls a set of commands 10 times. We could write conditionals that check the value of command outputs. Bash scripts combine powerful programming building blocks with the versatile commands we already know. These scripts can be saved and reused.

We will be introducing Bash scripting generally and then providing lots of practice!
